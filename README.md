# Docker
To run Docker to development run the following command:

```docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /usr/app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/usr/app create-react-appd```

Don't forget to run this following command before:

```docker image build -t create-react-app . -f Dockerfile.dev```

You don't need to have `node__modules` in your local machine!

## Run tests with Docker
You must have already did the `docker image build` of the Dockerfile.dev, to do this following command:

```docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /usr/app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/usr/app create-react-app npm run test```

If you want to have control when running the test, do this following command:

```docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /usr/app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/usr/app create-react-app npm run test```

## Run with docker-compose
The following command will start the web app and in another service will start to run tests (not on watch mode ðŸ˜¥ ):

```docker-compose up```

## Build then host on nginx
Should run:
```docker build . -t create-react-app-nginx```

The run:
```docker run -p 8080:80 create-react-app-nginx```

## Some cool commands
- `docker run -p 3000:3000 -v "$(pwd):/workspace" -w "/workspace" node:13.5.0-alpine3.11 npm start`
- `docker build -f Dockerfile -t osmarpetry/node . && docker run osmarpetry/node`
